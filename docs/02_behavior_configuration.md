# Behavior Configuration Layer

## Responsibility

This layer interprets the parsed command-line arguments and maps them into a `Behaviors` struct. This struct centralizes all runtime configuration, such as which actions to perform and how verbose the output should be.

## Example
```rust
let behaviors = Behaviors::from_args(&cli_args);
```

## Notes
- Encapsulates all user-selected behaviors for easy access throughout the application.
- Promotes maintainability and extensibility by centralizing configuration.
